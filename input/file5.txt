Stocks lost ground Tuesday, as another batch of earnings rolled in and investors awaited the Federal Reserve policy meeting and jobs data later this week.

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) turned lower by about 0.1% in midday trading, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) ticked lower nearly 0.2%. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell by 0.4%. All three indices had risen to start the session.

Investors digested economic releases on Tuesday, including the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) survey, which found that job openings unexpectedly rose in September to 10.7 million from 10.28 million last month. Economists had expected openings to decrease to about 10 million, which would have been in line with the kind of cooling the Federal Reserve wants to see in the labor market.
