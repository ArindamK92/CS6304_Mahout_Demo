 The original General Shepherd from 2009 Modern Warfare 2 is arguably the most well-known antagonist in the series. He returns in the rebooted sequel with a new actor but retains his role as a surprise villain. Shepherd was only mentioned in 2019's Modern Warfare. This time around, he's at the center of it all.

General Shepherd is in charge of the entire Task Force 141, the squad that the majority of playable characters are a part of. He plays a vital role in the campaign by sending the unit to stop terrorist forces and clean up a mess they don't know he created.
